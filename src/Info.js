        <h2>About Records</h2>
        <p>
         Each level of weightlifting has records, and while the local level are the ones this site is focused on, you may also be interested in working towards a national or international records. National records and standards are maintained by USAW, while international records are maintained by multiple governing bodies: the IWF maintains international records for youth, junior, and senior athletes. For masters lifters, there are two governing bodies with their own set of records: the UMWF and the IMWA.

            So what happens when an athlete breaks a record? And whose job is it to notice and ensure the record is recognized? 
        </p>
<p><strong>Local Records:</strong><br />At the local level, the WSO committee is keeping an eye out, but we're not all seeing, and do not get automatic notifications. Athletes and coaches who believe they've set a record are encouraged to reach out to the WSO committee and let us know. </p>
